Certainly! Let's design a three-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com with enhanced security, encrypted traffic, and monitoring capabilities.

Infrastructure Design:
Firewalls (3):

Purpose: To control and secure the incoming and outgoing network traffic.
Configuration: One firewall for each server (Server 1, Server 2, and Server 3).
Rule Example: Allow incoming traffic only on necessary ports (e.g., 80, 443, and SSH).
SSL Certificate:

Purpose: Encrypts data transmitted between the user's browser and the web server.
Configuration: Installed on the Load Balancer to secure HTTPS communication.
Monitoring Clients (Data Collectors):

Purpose: Collects performance and security-related data for analysis.
Configuration: Installed on each server (Server 1, Server 2, and Server 3).
Integration: Data sent to a centralized monitoring service (e.g., Sumologic).
Specifics:
Firewalls:

Control incoming and outgoing traffic, preventing unauthorized access and protecting against malicious activities.
SSL Certificate:

HTTPS encrypts data in transit, enhancing security and preventing data interception during communication.
Monitoring:

Monitors server health, performance, and security to identify issues proactively.
Collects data on CPU usage, memory, disk space, network activity, and potential security threats.
Monitoring Tool (Sumologic, etc.):

Collects logs and metrics from monitoring clients.
Provides real-time analysis, alerting, and visualization of server performance.
Monitoring Web Server QPS (Queries Per Second):

Monitor the web server logs for request counts or utilize performance metrics.
Set up alerts for abnormal QPS levels that may indicate performance issues or potential attacks.
Issues with the Infrastructure:
Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer:

Issue: Security risk as data is decrypted at the Load Balancer, leaving it vulnerable to potential attacks.
Mitigation: Implement end-to-end encryption by terminating SSL at the web servers.
Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes:

Issue: Single point of failure for write operations. If the MySQL server fails, write operations are affected.
Mitigation: Implement MySQL replication with a primary-replica setup for high availability.
Identical Components Across Servers:

Issue: Vulnerability to simultaneous failures or attacks on multiple servers due to identical configurations.
Mitigation: Diversify server configurations and consider distributing components across different server types for redundancy.
