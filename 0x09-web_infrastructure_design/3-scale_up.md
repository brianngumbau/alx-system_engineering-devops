Specifics:
New Server (Server 4):

Enhances scalability by distributing components across multiple servers.
Allows for better resource utilization and isolates potential failures to specific components.
Load Balancer Cluster:

Forms a high-availability cluster to ensure continuous service even if one load balancer fails.
Improves reliability and distributes traffic efficiently across multiple servers.
Split Components Across Servers:

Web Server on Server 1 and Server 4:

Distributes the load and improves response times for static content.
Isolates the web server from the application logic for better resource allocation.
Application Server on Server 2 and Server 4:

Distributes the load and provides redundancy for handling dynamic application logic.
Isolates the application server from the web server for better resource allocation.
Database on Server 3 and Server 4:

Distributes the load and provides redundancy for data storage.
Isolates the database from both the web and application servers for better security and resource allocation.
Explanation:
New Server for Scalability:

Adding a new server allows for better distribution of components, reducing the risk of a single point of failure and improving scalability.
Load Balancer Cluster:

A load balancer cluster ensures high availability and improved fault tolerance. If one load balancer fails, the other can seamlessly take over.
Split Components Across Servers:

Distributing components across multiple servers improves performance, scalability, and fault tolerance. It allows for better resource allocation and isolation of potential failures.
