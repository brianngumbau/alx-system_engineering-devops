Server (Physical or Virtual Machine):

A physical or virtual machine with the Linux operating system.
Domain Name and DNS:

Domain Name: foobar.com
DNS Record: A www record pointing to the server's IP address (e.g., 8.8.8.8).
The domain name serves as a human-readable alias for the server's IP address. The DNS record ensures that when a user types www.foobar.com, the request is directed to the correct IP address.

Web Server (Nginx):

Nginx is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and serving static content. It acts as a reverse proxy to the application server.
The web server receives requests from users and communicates with the application server to retrieve dynamic content.

Application Server:

The application server runs the application code (e.g., PHP code in this case). It processes dynamic content and interacts with the database server to fetch or update data.
In this setup, PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) can be used with Nginx to handle PHP requests.

Application Files (Code Base):

The application files include the source code of the website. These files are hosted on the server and are executed by the application server when a user requests a dynamic page.
Database (MySQL):

MySQL is used to store and retrieve data for the website. It stores information like user accounts, posts, or any other relevant data.
The application server communicates with the database to perform read and write operations based on user requests.

Communication with User's Computer:

The communication between the server and the user's computer is done over the internet using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. When a user enters www.foobar.com in their browser, a request is sent to the server, and the server responds with the requested web page.
Issues with this Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

Since all components (web server, application server, and database) are hosted on a single server, any failure in that server can lead to a complete outage. To address this, a more resilient infrastructure would involve multiple servers and redundancy.
Downtime during Maintenance:

Deploying new code or performing maintenance may require restarting the web server, leading to downtime. To minimize downtime, a load balancer and multiple servers can be introduced to enable rolling updates without service interruption.
Limited Scalability:

With only one server, the infrastructure may struggle to handle a significant increase in traffic. To scale, additional servers, load balancing, and other scalability measures are necessary.
